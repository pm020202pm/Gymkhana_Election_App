## STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO CONDUCT GYMKHANA ELECTION

## ROLE OF ADMIN :
1) START ELECTION : The Admin gives a name and duration of the election.<br>
3) REGISTERING CANDIDATES : The Admin registers every candidate writing his name and then tapping on either of the buttons :<br>
   President, GnS, SnT, MnC, AnC or Senator.
2) REGISTERING VOTERS : The Admin authorises every voter entering his ethereum address and by tapping the ‘Register Voter’ button.<br>

## ROLE OF VOTER :
1) LOGIN : The Voter logins using his ethereum address and secret key.<br>
2) VOTE : The Voter can see a list of candidates who have nominated for the election.<br>
          • On first tap on the ‘VOTE’ button in  a particular category, the candidate gets 5 points.<br>
          • On the second tap on the ‘VOTE’ button in the same category, the candidate gets 3 points.<br>
          • On the third tap on the ‘VOTE’ button in the same category, the candidate gets 1 points.<br>
            After that no vote gets casted even after tapping multiple times.
